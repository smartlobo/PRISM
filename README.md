# PRISM
The Python script, "PRISM.py" can be used specifically for the Yade DEM opensource software (which runs strictly on Linux) along 
with other existing modules. Therefore, the following downloads must be made:

-Installing Yade:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install yade

-The "numpy" and "scipy" modules should also be installed (a pip install is recommended)

After making the proper installations, "PRISM.py" can be ran by opening a terminal in the respective directory and entering the follow command:

yade PRISM.py
